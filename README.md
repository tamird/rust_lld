Rust with LLD!
==============

Requirements:
- LLVM 3.6 with LLD. Available on OSX via homebrew-versions (not yet homebrew proper). See: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/pull/37260
- Rust (tested with 2015-04-30 nightly) installed to $RUST_PREFIX

It works! Thanks @alexchandel!

```
$ ./build.sh
hello world!
```
